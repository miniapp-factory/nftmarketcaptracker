A modern, minimalist logo featuring a stylized upward trending line graph integrated with a stylized NFT token symbol. The graph line is a gradient from deep blue to bright teal, rising from left to right, forming a subtle arrow pointing upward. The NFT token symbol is a simple square with a subtle 3D effect and a small pixelated pattern inside, placed above the graph line. The background is a clean white with a faint subtle gradient to give depth. The overall design conveys growth, data, and digital collectibles.
